# Expense_Tracker - Block A Programming 12 - Matthew Ho, Frankie Wu, Jedric Chan
We hope you enjoy the expense tracker we have coded.

Name and task:
Matthew Ho - Adding expenses. collaborative coding was one of the experiences of all time. nothing special in my opinion. didnt really encounter any problems imo.  

Frankie Wu - Filtering/deleting expenses.

Jedric Chan - Calculation of total expenses. I enjoyed collaborative coding as it allowed for all of us to combine our ideas and strengths, making our work efficient and neat. I believe our biggest issue was simply the different schedules we had given our varying workloads in subjects.
